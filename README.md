Railcraft Retrogen
===============

This is a modification of cpw's Simple Retrogen mod that is slightly modified to be compatible with Railcraft's dynamic ore gen configs.

It has no explicit config files as that is handled by the Railcraft ore configs. You simply need to drop this mod alongside Railcraft and then go into the ore config and specify whether it should apply retrogen.
